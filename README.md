## Project Euler && Jest

This is a small project where I document the problems of [Project Euler](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/project-euler/) while learning how to use Jest

All the problems will be in the folder Euler.

There might be other folders with other kinds of problems such as common algorithms, data-structures, etc.

### Method

1. Each folder contains a problem and will be named with the format: p (problem) n (problem number) - problem-title. Example p1-multiples-of-3-and-5
2. Each folder contains a file name euler + problem number. euler1.js, euler2.js, ...
3. Each folder contains a euler.test.js where several tests that are already present on freeCodeCamp will be added.
4. After solving each problem and thinking of the final answer, I will also generate some answers from ChatGPT in order to compare methods.
